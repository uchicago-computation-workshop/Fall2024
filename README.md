# Fall2024

Repository for the Fall 2024 Computational Social Science Workshop

Time: 11:00 AM to 12:20 PM, Thursdays; Location: Kent 107; in present participation required (assessed by QR-code survey). 
*Fall 2024* will focus on introducing students to faculty across the university involved in Computational Social Science research through sessions of curated lightning talks. No online participation is required _expcept for *week 1*_. 

Note that Winter and Spring 2025 will be seminar-style, with a different (outside) speaker each week. Those quarters will involve required: 1) weekly reading associated with our speaker (like week 1 of this quarter); 2) posing an online question and answer about the reading (like week 1 of this quarter); and 3) attending in person (in 1155 E. 60th Street in Room 295).

## 10/3 
[James Evans](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/James-A-Evans) is the Max Palevsky Professor of Sociology & Data Science at the University of Chicago, External Faculty at the Santa Fe Institute, and Visiting Faculty at Google. Evans’ research uses large-scale data, machine learning and generative AI to understand how collectives of humans and machines think and what they know. This involves inquiry into the emergence of ideas, shared patterns of reasoning, and processes of attention, communication, agreement, and certainty. Thinking and knowing collectives like science, modern large language models, the Web, or modern commercial enterprises involve complex networks of diverse human and machine intelligences, collaborating and competing to achieve overlapping aims. Evans’ work connects the interaction of these agents with the knowledge they produce and its value for themselves and the system. His work is supported by numerous federal agencies (NSF, NIH, DOD), foundations and philanthropies, has been published in _Nature_, _Science_, _PNAS_, and top social and computer science outlets, and has been covered by global news outlets from the _New Yorker_, _Wall Street Journal_, and _New York Times_ to the _Economist_, _Le Monde_, and _Die Zeit_.

*Simulating Subjects: The Promise and Peril of AI Stand-ins for Social Agents and Interactions.* Large Language Models (LLMs), through their exposure to massive collections of online text, learn to reproduce the perspectives and linguistic styles of diverse social and cultural groups. This capability suggests a powerful social scientific application – the simulation of empirically realistic, culturally situated human subjects. Synthesizing recent research in artificial intelligence and computational social science, we outline a methodological foundation for simulating human subjects and their social interactions. We then identify nine characteristics of current models that are likely to impair realistic simulation human subjects, including atemporality, social acceptability bias, uniformity, and poverty of sensory experience. For each of these areas, we discuss promising approaches for overcoming their associated shortcomings. Given the rate of change of these models, we advocate for an ongoing methodological program on the simulation of human subjects that keeps pace with rapid technical progress.
